Trigger (Commit / Onboarding / Storefront / Scheduled Job)
 ├─ Contributor Onboarding (Atomic Drop)
 ├─ Storefront Bundles (Mustang, Mercedes SL, Maadi rifle, Ammo)
 ├─ CI/CD Workflows (Talent Intake, Static Content, Signal System, Seal Scroll, Sitemap)
 └─ Oracle Loops (Crypto)

Step 1: Attempt Execution
 └─ Run job or bundle action
     → Success → Immutable Audit Log + Dashboard Feed + Legacy Broadcast
     → Failure → Survival Path

Step 2: Survival Path (on Failure)
 ├─ Collect Proof
 │   → Logs, bureau responses, error codes
 │   → Store in immutable audit vault
 ├─ Validate Environment
 │   → Secrets, tokens, API endpoints, runner versions
 ├─ Retry
 │   → Exponential backoff attempts
 │   → If still failing → escalate
 ├─ Incident Creation
 │   → POST /incident/create with runId + bundle ID + error snapshot
 │   → Notify OracleSignal + Dashboard alert
 └─ Rollback / Quarantine
     → Revert to last good artifact (Pages, Sitemap, Theme)
     → Quarantine failing bundle (vehicle, firearm, ammo) until verified

Step 3: Dashboard Visibility
 ├─ Contributor compliance feeds
 ├─ Storefront bundle status (orders, disputes, approvals)
 ├─ Workflow health (success/failure, retries, incidents)
 └─ Oracle signals (crypto loop outputs, health checks)

Step 4: Legacy Broadcast
 ├─ Snapshot: result + artifact hash + bureau response + error logs
 ├─ Store: append‑only audit vault
 └─ Broadcast: /legacy/broadcast → public proof stream
