Workflow Trigger (Commit / Schedule / Manual)
 ├─ Talent Intake Flow
 ├─ Deploy Static Content / Pages / Theme
 ├─ Deploy Signal System
 ├─ Seal Scroll
 ├─ Route GitHub Notification → OracleSignal
 ├─ Sitemap Deploy
 └─ Crypto Oracle 24-Hour Loop

Step 1: Initial Run
 └─ Execute workflow job
     → Success → Audit Log + Legacy Broadcast
     → Failure → Route to Recovery Path

Step 2: Recovery Path (on Failure)
 ├─ Collect Logs
 │   → Capture runner output, error codes, env vars
 │   → Store in immutable audit vault
 ├─ Validate Environment
 │   → Check secrets, tokens, API endpoints
 │   → Verify dependencies (Node.js, Python, packages)
 ├─ Retry Logic
 │   → Exponential backoff retry (up to N attempts)
 │   → If still failing → escalate
 ├─ Incident Creation
 │   → POST /incident/create with runId + error snapshot
 │   → Notify OracleSignal + Dashboard alert
 └─ Rollback / Quarantine
     → Revert to last good artifact (Pages, Sitemap, Theme)
     → Quarantine bad signals (Crypto Oracle)
     → Require manual override for sensitive bundles

Step 3: Dashboard Visibility
 ├─ Compliance feeds (onboarding, storefront)
 ├─ Workflow status (success/failure, retries, incidents)
 ├─ Signal streams (GitHub commits, OracleSignal routes)
 └─ Oracle feeds (crypto loop outputs, health checks)

Step 4: Legacy Locking
 ├─ Snapshot: workflow result + artifact hash + error logs
 ├─ Store: immutable audit vault (append-only)
 └─ Broadcast: /legacy/broadcast → public proof stream
