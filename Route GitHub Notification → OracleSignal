Trigger → Notification Workflow
   → Capture commit event → Send to OracleSignal API
       → IF success → Audit Log → Dashboard → Legacy Broadcast
       → IF failure → Survival Path:
           → Collect Logs → Validate Env → Retry
           → Incident Ticket → Quarantine notification route
           → Legacy Broadcast → snapshot (runId + error logs)
